      <p>There is a true sense of dedication about Nick Priestland’s highly original country house with rooms. The Cors is “perfectly
        attuned to the relaxed atmosphere of Laugharne”, (The Times), offering just the sort of hospitality that both travellers
        and locals appreciate. It’s a very personal operation, with attentive service and good modern British food served
        in the hugely atmospheric candle lit dining room. The cooking is based on sound technique and “clearly cooked with
        passion, (The Good Food Guide).”</p>
      <p>“A bohemian bolthole, one of the best, tucked away in the middle of this attractive little town dominated by a ruined
        castle overlooking the estuary is this rather unexpected country house with rooms. Set in two and a half acres of
        formally landscaped gardens and with an elegant facade, it is every inch the country villa from the outside, so the
        interior, with its air of French grandeur, comes as something as a revelation. Nick is a cook, an artist and gardener;
        his exotic garden is a beautiful retreat in the summer. Gunnera, bamboo and tree ferns flourish while the river Corran
        potters past – not a bad stop for tea and drinks in the summer! Inside is a small, personal world of French inspiration,
        large abstract paintings, bright colours and worn rugs on stripped boards, get things off to a lively start in the
        bar and lounge. The bar sweeps you back to 1950’s Paris, with doors that open onto a Victorian veranda, where wisteria
        and clematis ramble. You then move on to the imitate candlelit opulence of the dining room with its gilt mirrors
        and rich claret reds” (Sawday’s).</p>
