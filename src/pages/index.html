    <h1>About The Cors</h1>
    <p>
      There is true sense of dedication about Nick Priestland highly original country house with rooms. The Cors is ‘perfectly attuned to the relaxed atmosphere of Laugharne’, offering just the sort of hospitality the both travelers and locals appreciate. It’s a very personal operation, with attentive service and good modern British food severed in the hugely atmospheric candle lit dining room. The cooking is based on sound technique and ’clearly cooked with passion’.

      A bohemian bolthole, one of the best, tucked away in the middle of this attractive little town dominated by a ruined castle over looking the estry is this rather unexpected country house with rooms. Set in two and a half acres a formally landscaped gardens and with an elegant facade, it is every inch the country villa from the outside, so the inertia with its air of French grandeur, comes as something as a revelation.
      Nick is a cook, an artist and gardener, his exotic garden is a beautiful retreat in the summer. Gunnera, bamboo and tree ferns flourish while the river Corren potters past – not a bad stop for tea and drinks in the summer!

      Inside small, personal world of French inspiration, large abstract paintings, bright colours and warn rugged on stripped boards get things of to a lively start in the bar and lounge.
      The bar sweeps you back to 1950’s Paris, then doors that open onto a Victorian verandah, where wisteria and clematis ramble.
      You then move on to the imitate candlelit opulence dining room with its guilt mirrors and rich claret reds.
