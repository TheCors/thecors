      <p class="lead subheader">Hidden from the main street in Laugharne, behind its exotically landscaped grounds, is The Cors, a very special country house.</p>
      <p>Converted from an exquisite Victorian house, we have brought this building to life and created a charming blend of period pieces and modernist artworks. A bohemian bolt hole, one of the best - the 2-acre garden is a perfect retreat in the summer months. The artistic sensibility is visible in everything we do from the drama of the gardens to the decoration of the house. Perfect for family breaks or friends getting together, we are sure The Cors Country House will not disappoint.</p>
