      <h1>About The Cors Country House</h1>
      <p>
        Come and experience the bohemian bolthole as an entire house tucked away in the middle of this attractive little town
        dominated by a ruined castle overlooking the estuary is this rather unexpected country house with rooms. Set in two and a half acres of formally
        landscaped gardens and with an elegant facade, it is every inch the country villa from the outside, so the interior, with its air of French grandeur,
        comes as something as a revelation. The exotic garden is a beautiful retreat in the summer. Gunnera, bamboo and tree ferns flourish while the
        river Corran potters past – perfect for summer gatherings!</p>
